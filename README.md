# leaflet-challenge
This repo incorporates the use of leaflet and js to visualise information on earthquakes provided by the United States Geological Survey. The leaflet map produced outlines the location of any earthquake within the last 7-days, the magnitude of the quake and the depth of the point of origin (how deep compared to sea-level). 
The size of each visualised quake is dependent on the magnitude of the earthquake, with higher magnitudes resulting in a larger radius. The color is determined by the depth, with a legend displaying the coloured variations.

The layout of the repo is as follows:
1) Index- the html responsible for the visualisation
2) Static folder- contains both the css and js scripts
